Skywave is a blog about amateur radio and other fun stuff! It is written by me,
Keegan McAllister, callsign KM6PNI.

# About me

I've been interested in technology for my whole life. I have a lot of
experience in the software world, but lately I've been more into electronics
and ham radio. I love the DIY spirit, the mixture of old and new technology,
and the way the amateur radio bands form a worldwide public commons.

I got my first ham radio license in January 2018 and have since upgraded to
Extra class. My interests within ham radio include emergency communication, HF
digital modes, public service events, APRS, and mesh networking. Since I live
in a small apartment, I focus on stuff that I can take to the park or on a
camping trip.

Other interests of mine include camping, mycology, disaster preparedness, and
psychedelia. I'm a 30-something woman and I live with my wife Cathy (KM6PNH) in
the sunny city of San Francisco, California.

# About the name

[Skywave propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywave) is what allows
signals on the ham HF bands to travel around the world.
